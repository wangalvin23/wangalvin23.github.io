            <h3>June 23, 2020 | My story about robotics</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            With the coronavirus still in the air, I've definitely taken the
            time to look back at my life and tried to remember all the things
            that I have accomplished. However, all of it seems so distant,
            almost as if it has happened centuries before. I haven't even lived
            20 years, and it has already felt like an eternity. Even my
            beginnings in art and videogames, things that I still fit in into my
            daily schedule, are distant and somewhat unclear to me. But,
            robotics hasn't been one of those things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still remember myself in freshman year, about to enter a world
            called high school: an extremely daunting thought that I didn't want
            to think about. In fact, at the time, I didn't really know much
            about life in high school. I knew that it was definitely a lot more
            stressful than middle school, but I didn't know by how much. The
            only thing I knew about high school was the school robotics team,
            which my brother joined when he was in his freshman year 5 years
            prior. I remember when I was still in 7th grade, when my brother
            would host robotics meetings in our garage. Every time, there were
            pool noodles all over the floor, a big recycling bin, a bunch of
            crates, and of course, food all over the tables. I would just sit
            there, have my ears deafened by the screeching of the wheels and
            robotic arms, and stare at the robot, which would pick up a
            recycling bin and magically stack it on top of 4-5 crates. I can
            still see the numbers labeled on the robot, showing the numbers
            2854.
          </p>
          <p>
            You see, this wasn't just some side project that high school
            students put together for fun. It was so that they could compete in
            the FIRST Robotics Competition regionals: a worldwide robotics
            competition, where highschool students come together and compete in
            whatever challenge FIRST decides for that year. That challenge that
            my brother had to compete in that year with the recycling bins and
            crates, for example, was Recycle Rush, and teams would score points
            by stacking crates and bins on top of each other and moving them
            onto designated platforms. That challenge would end up being one of
            the most disliked of the bunch, but to say building a robot that can
            stack crates and bins accurately and carry them around would be
            wrong as well. I, who was really into video games, loved the idea of
            these competitions, and I just couldn't wait to drive it myself. Of
            course, my older brother would never let me even get close to the
            controller, probably for the better, but it gave me a set goal that
            I wanted to achieve.
          </p>
          <p>
            So then it became my turn to live through high school, and I
            naturally signed up to be in the robotics club. The first couple
            meetings went by, and after people started to settle in, myself
            included, we went on to learn each other's names in the team. It
            almost spread like wildfire amongst the senior club members, as I
            would be known as "Kevin Wang's little brother". Apparently my
            brother was the lead programmer, and he just so happened to be one
            of the best the team has ever had. Naturally, many people, including
            myself, expected me to become that same great programmer. I had some
            programming experience from the prior summer, but I was nowhere
            close to being anywhere close to a programming legend. I even,
            admittingly, didn't really like the feeling of coding for countless
            hours at the time. Still, despite all of that, I still decided to
            join the programming division in the robotics team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some might have assumed that that would be that; that I would
            continue on to be the next programming lead of the team. But that
            would be far from the case. The truth was that I simply just didn't
            enjoy programming at the time. While everyone else was drilling
            things and wiring electronics, I was just on my laptop installing
            things and waiting around. There just wasn't enough satisfaction to
            keep myself interested. It seems strange that someone who now has
            made his own personal website and all would find programming
            unsatisfactory. However, at the time, it felt as if I was mentally
            pushing myself to live up to the expectations put on top of me
            rather than having fun and learning new things. It was for that
            reason that I decided to drop from the programming team and move on
            to electrical: a change that I think was better for both the team
            and myself. I still was "Kevin's little brother", but now felt less
            pressured on being mentally forced into following his footsteps. I
            felt more relieved and was able to learn much more about robotics
            and bond with my teammates more because of this role swap.
          </p>
          <p>
            It still strikes me to this day, that these series of events only
            happened a couple of years ago and that it would lead to so many
            memorable experiences. That same freshman year, our team would be
            invited to compete at the world championship happening at Houston
            for acquiring the engineering inspiration award: the second best
            possible award that could be given. I also happened to be the
            secondary driver that year, who is supposed to move the robot arms
            and elevator up and down, which finally let me live the childhood
            dream that I always had of driving the robot. The combination of the
            intensity of the crowd, the stress of driving the robot, and the
            worry that everything will go south was a feeling that I always
            wanted to feel: the feeling of competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although driving the robot that year would be satisfying, I never
            expected what was to come. The next year, I would meet so many more
            people and make many close friends, along with assisting in teaching
            and guiding new members in the club. This past season, before the
            self-quarantines began, would be one of my first times presenting in
            front of other students at middle schools, trying to share my love
            and experience for robotics, as well as tackle side projects such as
            team merchandise. With most of the members on the team already
            graduated, it was refreshing to meet and connect with so many new
            members, and it seriously felt as if our team membership doubled. As
            much as I want to compete at the world championship stage again, all
            of the laughter, jokes, friendships, and hardships has already
            satisfied me enough, and all I wish is to have a great season with
            my team the following year to end my highschool career.
