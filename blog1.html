            <h3>June 18, 2020 | How an art class shaped my life</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Art has always fascinated me in its many different forms. From
            cartoons, movies, and animes, to still lifes, portraits, and
            landscapes, art has always been something that I wanted to get
            better at. As a young boy waiting to have his first taste of
            kindergarten, I watched my brother come home from art class every
            Thursday with a new art piece. It was almost as if the art class was
            printing pictures for their students to bring home. Naturally
            following the steps of my older brother, my parents signed me up for
            the same art class, and I would never have expected this art studio
            to be my second home for the next 12 years and counting. This home
            was The Lord of the Light Art Studio.
          </p>
          <p>
            I, too, started to draw the very same pictures as my brother, and
            every week, I would sit down and draw whatever the teachers had
            planned for me on the board for half an hour, and then work through
            their curriculum for another hour. Even to today, that's pretty much
            all that happened every single class for the past 12 years. Through
            the years, I completed all of their Star curriculum, which was
            focused on younger students, and their core curriculum levels 1-10.
            A few things changed, like after I was around 6th grade or so, I
            stopped doing the weekly drawings and paid full attention to their
            curriculum, and my brother would eventually stop going since he
            needed to get ready for college. However, at the core, every class
            was essentially the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working through their curriculum has definitely refined my artistic
            abilities. From the simple shading and understanding where tints and
            shadows should be, to the more challenging things such as
            composition and giving life and energy to a piece, it is very
            apparent from the highlights shown in my art gallery
            (LINKLINKLINKLINK), that I have improved over the years. But on a
            deeper level, it did far more than just improving my drawing skills.
            It taught me why the combination of persistence, resilience, and
            curiosity was so important in the creation of all the pieces I made.
            The more persistent I became, the more I wanted to further refine
            works that many would say to already be complete. The more resilient
            I became, the less worried I was whenever I made a mistake. The more
            curious I became, the more I wanted to try out new challenging
            pieces, which further boosted both my persistence and resilience.
            Where these 3 traits have all helped me create more beautiful and
            intricate artworks, it has more importantly led me to do everything
            I have done today, such as doing robotics at my school, studying for
            exams, and even playing games.
          </p>
          <p>
            This art class certainly has changed me for the better, yet I never
            really knew what was to come next. Like I mentioned, each class was
            pretty much the same routine repeating over and over again. That's
            why I was surprised to hear that high school students had the
            opportunity to intern as an art teacher at their studio. I was
            initially hesitant, after all, I have never been a teacher before to
            anyone else beforehand. However, almost as if the art class already
            trained me for this, I knew this was an opportunity that I couldn't
            give up, so I signed up to be an intern. After their intern
            training, which doubled as a mass interview session, it was revealed
            that I didn't make the cut. I was disappointed, but I didn't let it
            get the best of me, and I knew I just had to let it go.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following year, after another year's worth of drawings,
            paintings, and sculptures, I signed up for their internship program
            again. Once again, I went through their intern training meeting, and
            if it was almost like magic, I got selected to be one of the 10
            interns that year: a start to a school year that I will never
            forget. It does seem easy on the surface to teach something that you
            already know. After all, you already know it yourself, so it should
            be easy to be able to just talk it all out. But then, you realize
            that the people you are teaching are children that aren't even 10
            years old yet, and their motor skills aren't as refined as the
            average adult. Through teaching multiple students throughout the
            week, I realized I had to simplify my vocabulary, make more
            difficult tasks seem more straightforward, and even slow down my
            talking speed so that the students could digest whatever I was
            saying to them. It was just one of those things I personally never
            really thought about, but realized immediately after the first
            couple of days working there. It was definitely an unique experience
            that taught me a lot of valuable life lessons and further prepared
            me in leadership positions that I would hold in later years.
