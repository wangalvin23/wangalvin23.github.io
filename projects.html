            This is the first project that I've made ever since my first clicker
            game. Stormo is my personal website which consists of some blogs and
            some highlights of my many art pieces. It only uses HTML and CSS,
            and has taught me many of the basic understandings of the two
            languages and general web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            When making the navigation links in the navbar and footer, I chose
            to use the "div" element over "nav" and "footer" elements. This was
            because when I was first using CSS, I had trouble understanding the
            purposes of the different selectors in CSS. For this project, I
            chose to limit the elements that I used to simplify the task at
            hand, and as a result, has let me understand the uses of the CSS
            selectors without any extra clutter. With only div classes and basic
            elements, I was able to fully understand what the selectors had to
            offer, and I plan to use more elements in future projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            One exception to this, however, was when I had to deal with the
            gallery navigation links. The problem with using the div element in
            this case was that when writing the CSS, I would have to use many
            comma selectors to style all of the different classes. I could've
            just directly styled the div using a child selector, but I decided
            to use the section element and its id # to simplify things. This
            would end up being the same result, as instead of just directly
            styling all of the div elements, I would just be styling all of the
            sections. However, since the section element was only implemented on
            this page, I was certain that the styles applied to those elements
            wouldn't change other parts of code and had less of a chance of
            possible bugs.
          </p>

            The color scheme went through a lot of different iterations. The
            first was going to be an all white background with blue and green
            accents, with the navbar and footer being a light grey. Although
            this did look great, I wanted the website to really visually show
            what I enjoyed, since its purpose was to showcase who I am and what
            I do, and I wanted the design to compliment that purpose. This led
            the next iteration of the design, which was a dark background with
            blue and yellow highlights. This overall just felt more cohesive and
            better represented me through just the colors alone, and I'm happy
            with how the colors turned out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I'm extremely proud of what I have accomplished with this
            project, and this project in particular has inspired me to tackle
            more difficult challenges and to further expand my abilities in UX
            design and web development. Most of the techniques applied were
            basic, to say the least, and I wish to not only further update this
            website with more blogs and projects, but to also update the overall
            structure of the website itself when I learn more about the full
            potential HTML, CSS, and JS have to offer.

            This game, I believe, is to be my first programming creation. It was
            a simple clicker game made with the resources given in Android
            Studio, and was coded using Java. It consisted of 3 buttons: a
            start, restart, and "click me" button. The goal was to pretty much
            click the "click me" button as many times as possible after hitting
            the start button in 15 seconds. After the 15 seconds were over, the
            message "FINISH!" would appear, and the user would have to option to
            press the restart button to restart the timer. I made it so that the
            user couldn't restart the time in the middle of an attempt to
            prevent any misclicks, as well as not making the time immediately
            start to count down after restarting to allow the user to rest their
            fingers.

            Although this app was never released into the Google Play Store, I
            felt very satisfied with the app I made, given the fact I had only a
            couple weeks of learning how to use Android Studio and how Java
            classes and properties work. I wouldn't tackle another programming
            challenge after this, however, as the thought of coding in front of
            a computer every day didn't seem enjoyable for me, especially when I
            could be playing video games or drawing instead. However, I believe
            the amount of satisfaction that I got from this coding project
            eventually sparked my interest to get back into programming.
